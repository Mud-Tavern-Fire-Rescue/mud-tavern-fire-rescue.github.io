Mud Tavern Volunteer Fire and Rescue is always open to volunteers! Not all volunteers are firefighters, but if that's what you are interested in, we will train you to be one of the best. There are many different roles in a fire department and we always need help! If you have an interest in serving your community, please get in touch with us today!

We have general business meetings every first and third Thursday of the month. Training is every second and fourth Thursday of the month. Meetings and training start at 7:00 pm. If you are interested in learning more, we invite you to stop by on Thursday night. Someone will be able to talk to you about what you can expect as a volunteer.
